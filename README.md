My Tweet Week
=============
A simple Ruby application that displays a resume of your week on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), designed for the purpose of demonstrating how to use [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com).

Development
-----------
1. If you are using [RVM](http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/) use MRI 1.9.2 with `rvm use 1.9.2`, after that create a new gemset with `rvm gemset create open-taskboard-api` and then use it with `rvm gemset use open-taskboard-api`
2. Install Bundler with `gem install bundler`
3. If you want to deploy to [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com), install the gem with `gem install heroku`. Note: Use the 1.9.2 deployment stack with `heroku stack:migrate bamboo-mri-1.9.2`.
